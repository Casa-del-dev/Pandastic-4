"""Resolve CCMT (Ghana, CC BY 4.0) raw maize images to their public S3 URLs -> ml/leaf/ccmt_files.csv.

Mendeley serves each CCMT image as a separate file and blocks cloud IPs (403 from Modal), but every file
redirects to an unsigned public S3 object. Run this once from a normal connection; Modal then downloads the
S3 URLs directly. The Mendeley URL stays in the CSV as the citation.

Usage (from ml/): ../ml/.venv/Scripts/python -m leaf.resolve_ccmt
